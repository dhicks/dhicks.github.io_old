		Dan Hicks, a Philosopher
		</h2>
		
		<p> Welcome!  As of September 2015, I am a Science and Technology Policy Fellow with the American Association for the Advancement of Science, working in the Chemical Safety for Sustainability Program at the US Environmental Protection Agency. </p>
		
		<p> By training, I am a philosopher of science, social/political philosopher, and science studies scholar.  Broadly speaking, I am interested in the ways in which science, as a productive activity, is socially organized and interacts with other kinds of activities and organizations, such as social movements, the state, and the market.  I am specifically interested in the problem of distinguishing legitimate from illegitimate kinds of influence on science.  I also have related interests in the problems of complex evidence and uncertainty.  Policy-relevant science is often complex — involving multiple different research methods and kinds of evidence — contested for political reasons, and uncertain to some degree or another.  What kinds of conclusions can we legitimately draw from complex, contested, and uncertain research?  How should this research be used to inform good policymaking?  Besides my work at the EPA, I am exploring these issues with an ongoing case study on the controversy surrounding genetically modified organisms. </p>
		
		<p> From August 2013 through August 2015, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Rotman Institue of Philosophy at Western University in London, Ontario.  I finished my Ph.D. in philosophy at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana, in April 2012.  While I was a grad student, I also taught for Johns Hopkins' CTY Summer program, which is an academic "summer camp" for 12-16-year-olds.  I taught classes on chaos theory and fractal geometry and various logic courses at various CTY sites on both coasts, but I primarily taught critical thinking / informal logic at the Baltimore site at the Hopkins Homewood campus.  I've also taught philosophy and math at various community colleges and the IU campus in South Bend.  Before coming to Notre Dame, I did some graduate work in the math and philosophy departments at the University of Illinois, Chicago, and majored in math and political science at the University of Puget Sound in Tacoma, Washington.  While at Puget Sound, I was in the Honors Program (a Great Books program by another name) and participated in various debate, music, and undergraduate research activities.  I was born and grew up in Northern California. </p>
