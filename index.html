		Daniel J. Hicks, PhD
		</h2>
		
		<p> I am a philosopher of science, science and technology studies [STS] scholar, and data scientist.  My primary academic research focuses on the role of ethical and political values in science and public scientific controversies.  I'm also interested in bibliometrics, the use of statistics in scientific practice, and science policy.  </p>
		
		<p> In September 2017 I joined the Data Science Initiative at UC Davis as a Postdoctoral Researcher.  During my postdoc, I will develop a portfolio of projects related to "academic institutional effectiveness."  These projects will draw on a variety of datasets — student enrollment data, faculty data such as grant applications, library or wifi use data, as well external data such as transcripts of government meetings and publication metadata — to address concrete questions about the inner workings and social impact of UC Davis.  </p>

		<p> From 2015 to 2017 I was a AAAS Science and Technology Policy Fellow.  I spent 2015-16 with the US Environmental Protection Agency's Chemical Safety for Sustainability program; and 2016-17 with the National Science Foundation, where I worked primarily with the National Robotics Initiative.  During my time in government, my major projects included portfolio analyses using bibliometrics data. </p>
		
		<p> From 2013 through 2015, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Rotman Institue of Philosophy at Western University in London, Ontario.  I finished my PhD in philosophy at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana, in April 2012.  During grad school I also taught for Johns Hopkins' CTY Summer program, which is an academic "summer camp" for 12-16-year-olds.  Before coming to Notre Dame, I did some graduate work in the math and philosophy departments at the University of Illinois, Chicago, and majored in math and political science at the University of Puget Sound in Tacoma, Washington.  While at Puget Sound, I was in the Honors Program (a Great Books program by another name) and participated in various debate, music, and undergraduate research activities.  I was born and grew up in Northern California. </p>
		
		<p> In 2013, I served on on the board of directors of Purple Porch Co-op, a local food co-operative in South Bend, Indiana.  I was the board's secretary and co-chaired two committees related to membership and community events.  During 2017 I was involved with a deep canvassing project with the Northern Virginia and Washington, DC, chapters of Showing Up for Racial Justice [SURJ].  I wrote a theory of change for deep canvassing on racial justice and helped pilot the collection and analysis of quantitative and qualitative data.</p>
		
<!--		
		<p> Welcome!  As of September 2015, I am a Science and Technology Policy Fellow with the American Association for the Advancement of Science, hosted by the Chemical Safety for Sustainability Program at the US Environmental Protection Agency. </p>
		
		<p> By training, I am a philosopher of science, social/political philosopher, and science studies scholar.  Broadly speaking, I am interested in the ways in which science, as a productive activity, is socially organized and interacts with other kinds of activities and organizations, such as social movements, the state, and the market.  I am specifically interested in the problem of distinguishing legitimate from illegitimate kinds of influence on science.  I also have related interests in the problems of complex evidence and uncertainty.  Policy-relevant science is often complex — involving multiple different research methods and kinds of evidence — contested for political reasons, and uncertain to some degree or another.  What kinds of conclusions can we legitimately draw from complex, contested, and uncertain research?  How should this research be used to inform good policymaking?  Besides my work at the EPA, I am exploring these issues with an ongoing case study on the controversy surrounding genetically modified organisms. </p>

I finished my Ph.D. in philosophy at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana, in April 2012.  While I was a grad student, I also taught for Johns Hopkins' CTY Summer program, which is an academic "summer camp" for 12-16-year-olds.  I taught classes on chaos theory and fractal geometry and various logic courses at various CTY sites on both coasts, but I primarily taught critical thinking / informal logic at the Baltimore site at the Hopkins Homewood campus.  I've also taught philosophy and math at various community colleges and the IU campus in South Bend.  Before coming to Notre Dame, I did some graduate work in the math and philosophy departments at the University of Illinois, Chicago, and majored in math and political science at the University of Puget Sound in Tacoma, Washington.
