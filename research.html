		<p> My research deals with philosophy of science and political philosophy, and especially the intersection of the two.  I am generally interested in what might be called the political economy of science:  the ways in which science, as a productive activity, is socially organized and interacts with other kinds of activities and organizations (social movements, the state, the market, etc.).  My focus is on distinguishing legitimate from illegitimate kinds of influence on science.  My primary work at the moment is on two related projects, on the commercialization of scientific research and on the controversy surrounding genetically modified organisms.  I have broad interests, so at any given time I'm usually working on some side projects as well. </p>

		<h3> <i>Scientific practices and their social context</i> </h3>
			<p>
			My dissertation is, primarily, a contribution to a body of literature
			in philosophy of science that is often called the science and values
			debate.  In brief, this debate concerns the legitimate influence
			that ethical and political values may have on scientific inquiry.  
			In the terminology that I introduce, <em>isolationists</em>
			believe that this influence is only legitimate in certain aspects of
			scientific inquiry, such as the choice of research problems; however,
			these values may not legitimately influence the standards for knowledge
			itself, which must, on this view, remain ``value-free.''  By
			contrast, <em>transactionists</em>
			believe that this influence is, at least in principle, legitimate with
			respect to all aspects of scientific inquiry, including the standards
			for knowledge.
			</p>
			<p>
			This debate is normally, and inadequately, construed as an
			epistemological controversy: What role should values play in
			normative epistemology? I argue that it is in fact better
			construed in terms of the social relations between several kinds of
			concrete, goal-oriented, social or collaborative activities -- between
			different human practices. In the first few chapters, I develop a
			general conception of such practices, developing the work of Alasdair
			MacIntyre and drawing on John Dewey and work in philosophy of science
			of the past thirty years. I then develop two distinct conceptions
			of science as a practice, and use them to recast the science and values
			debate "from the perspective of practice."  The question, on
			this construal, is (for example) how should the practice of scientific
			inquiry be related to such activities as feminist activism and
			corporate profit-seeking? In the words of the title, the debate
			concerns the relationship between scientific practices and their social
			context. Key to this reconstrual are a pair of claims that I call
			the <em>connection hypotheses</em>. 
			These hypotheses claim that the two basic positions in the science and
			values debate depend on the two distinct conceptions of science.
			One, a "narrowly" epistemic conception, leads to isolationism; the
			second, a "broader," more pragmatic conception, leads to
			transactionism. In other words, the epistemological construal
			conceals rival assumptions concerning the goals and social organization
			of scientific inquiry.
			</p>
	      	<p>
			In the long final chapter (roughly the final 25% of the dissertation),
			I attempt to support the intuition that certain kinds of influence on
			scientific inquiry -- such as excessive commodification or
			manipulation for the sake of partisan political gain -- are forms of
			injustice, but others -- such as feminist critique of androcentric
			assumptions -- are not. To do so, I show how the conception of
			practice can be embedded within and inform a conception of justice from
			liberal political philosophy. This leads me to consider whether
			the conception of practice -- which emphasizes collaboration and
			social interdependence, and which is the product of a deeply
			anti-individualist intellectual tradition -- is really compatible with
			liberal individualism.

			Electronic copies of my dissertation are available upon request.  I have an article-length manuscript, "<a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B6oYmzobonqoXzM0WTI2M2lMeTA/edit">Scientific Practices and the Science and Values Debate</a>," which attempts to introduce the central machinery of the conception of practice and the connection argument.
