		<h3> The GM controversy </h3>
		
			<p> The controversy over genetically modified [GM] crops is frequently framed in terms of health and public ignorance:  members of the public are primarily worried about health hazards to human consumers, and so the controversy persists because the public is ignorant of the scientific evidence showing that GM foods are safe to eat.  A primary aim of my research is to complicate and challenge this framing.  Both substantial social scientific research on the controversy and attention to the actual concerns raised by opponents of GM crops show that opponents also have environmental, economic, and political concerns.  As a basic logical point, these concerns cannot be addressed by any amount of evidence concerning the safety of GM foods. </p>
			<p> In addition, I am interested in GM crop yields research as a case study of the interaction between values (especially commercial interests and rival views of food production), the methods that scientists use to study complex biological and social systems, and technology development. </p>

					<p> This paper examines the scientific controversy over the yields of genetically modified [GM] crops as a case study in epistemologically deep disagreements. Appeals to “the evidence” are inadequate to resolve such disagreements; not because the interlocutors have radically different metaphysical views (as in cases of incommensurability), but instead because they assume rival epistemological frameworks and so have incompatible views about what kinds of research methods and claims count as evidence. Specifically, I show that, in the yield debate, proponents and opponents of GM crops cite two different sets of claims as evidence, which correspond to two rival epistemological frameworks, classical experimental epistemology and Nancy Cartwright's evidence for use. I go on to argue that, even if both sides of the debate accepted Cartwright's view, they might still disagree over what counts as evidence, because evidence for use ties standards of evidence to what is sometimes called the “context of application.” </p>

		<h3> Science and values </h3>
		
			<p> The corner of philosophy of science called "science and values" deals with the role of ethical and political values in scientific research.  For the last two or three decades of the twentieth century, the primary debate in science and values was whether values had any legitimate role to play in science.  Today many, though not all, experts working in science and values agree that some ethical and political values have some legitimate roles in every aspect or stage of research, including the evaluation and acceptance of hypotheses.  I have argued that, consequently, the primary question facing us today is how to separate legitimate and illegitimate cases.  What separates the positive influence of feminism in various social science and fields of biology from the negative influence of commercial values in pharmaceutical research scandals?  I believe that these questions are best answered by engaging with work in ethics, political philosophy, and sociology.

					<p> The controversy over the old ideal of “value-free science” has cooled sig- nificantly over the past decade. Many philosophers of science now agree that even ethical and political values may play a substantial role in all aspects of scientific inquiry. Consequently, in the last few years, work in science and values has become more specific: Which values may influence science, and in which ways? Or, how do we distinguish illegitimate from illegitimate kinds of influence? In this paper, I argue that this problem requires philosophers of science to take a new direction. I present two case studies in the influence of values on scientific inquiry: feminist values in archaeology and commercial values in pharmaceutical research. I offer a preliminary assessment of these cases, that the influence of values was legitimate in the feminist case, but not in the pharmaceutical case. I then turn to three major approaches to distinguish legitimate from illegitimate influences of values, including the distinction between epistemic and non-epistemic values and Heather Douglas’ distinction between direct and indirect roles for values. I argue that none of these three approaches gives an adequate analysis of the two cases. In the concluding section, I briefly sketch my own approach, which draws more heavily on ethics than the others, and is more promising as a solution to the current problem. This is the new direction in which I think science and values should move. </p>

					<p> In this article I first use Alasdair MacIntyre’s conception of a practice to develop a version of the common, although increasingly controversial, ideal of value-free, value-neutral, or autonomous science. I then briefly show how this ideal has been used by some philosophers to criticize both governmental and commercial funding of science. I go on to argue that, far from being value neutral, certain elements of this ideal strongly resemble some controversial elements of libertarian political philosophy. I suggest that alternative ideals for science might be developed by drawing on egalitarian liberal and communitarian political philosophy. </p>

					<p> Helen Longino’s account of objectivity has been highly regarded by both feminist and mainstream philosophers of science. However, I have encountered three feminist philosophers who have all offered one especially compelling feminist critique of Longino’s view: far from vindicating or privileging the work of feminist scientists, Longino’s account actually requires the active cultivation of anti-feminist and misog- ynist scientists to balance out the possibility of feminist bias. I call this objection the Nazi problem, for the particular version that claims that her view requires even the active cultivation of Nazi scientists in objective inquiry. In this paper I consider one response to the Nazi problem, which I call the good faith argument. I show that the good faith argument itself is just as objectionable, on feminist grounds, as the Nazi problem it is meant to address.

		<h3> Feminist philosophy </h3>
		
			<p> Feminist philosophy provides an important paradigm for academic work that is simultaneously rigorous, socially relevant, and committed to substantive ethical and political values.  Feminist philosophy shows that good philosophy — and by extension, other research — does not need to be value-free, and indeed that substantive value commitments can lead to important and useful insights. </p>

					<p> Susan Moller Okin's critique of libertarianism in Justice, Gender, and the Family has received only slight attention in the libertarian literature. I find this neglect of Okin's argument surprising: The argument is straightforward and, if sound, it establishes a devastating conflict between the core libertarian notions of self-ownership and the acquisition of property through labour. In this paper, I first present a reconstruction of Okin's argument. In brief, she points out that mothers make children through their labour; thus it would seem that mothers own their (adult) children; but this implies that the children are not self-owners. I then examine the two most common objections to this argument in the literature: mothers do not make children, and acquisition by labour includes an exception for persons. I give several replies to each objection, including an extension of Okin's argument that I call Okin's dilemma. This dilemma argues that the libertarian can avoid Okin's conclusion only by requiring an involuntary property transfer. And this alternative, it seems, is just as unacceptable for many libertarians. I close with some speculation about the further implications of Okin's dilemma for libertarianism. </p>
